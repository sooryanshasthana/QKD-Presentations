# QKD-Presentations
This repository contains a structured set of presentations covering the fundamentals of **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**, including basic protocols, experimental implementation details, practical attacks, and modern security proofs.

## **Contents**

### **Basic QKD Protocols**

* BB84
* B92
* E91
* SARG04
* Decoy-state QKD

Each deck introduces intuition, protocol steps, error handling, and key-rate–relevant ideas.

---

### **Experimental Aspects**

Topics include:

* Single-photon sources (weak coherent pulses, SPDC)
* Detectors and efficiencies
* Fiber and free-space quantum channels
* Loss, noise, QBER, and visibility
* Practical system architectures

---

### **Attacks on QKD**

Covers both theoretical and implementation-level vulnerabilities:

* Intercept–resend
* Photon-number-splitting (PNS)
* Detector blinding & time-shift attacks
* Trojan-horse and other side channels
* Finite-key effects

---

### **Security Proofs**

A concise introduction to:

* Information-theoretic security
* Entanglement-based formulations
* Shor–Preskill-type proofs
* Composable security
* Smooth min-entropy & finite-key analysis
